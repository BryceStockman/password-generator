# password-generator

## Description

This is a password generator (PG). The user has the ability to enter the password length that they would like. When they click on the generate password button, they will be lead through a series of prompts asking them what character sets they would like to have, including: lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers and special characters. Once they have answered all the prompts, and have at least confirmed one option, the PG will display the user password in the box where the user can copy and pasted the password wherever they like. If the user does not select any of the character set prompts, the PG will send an alert informing the user that they did not select any of the password criteria and they user will then have to start over.

## Caveat

For additional learning and complexity I added an input box where the user could select a length option instead of a prompt. Additionally, there is a timeout function where after 5 seconds the user will be asked if they would like to generate a new password. If they confirm the PG will reset and they can generate a new password, if they negate the reset prompt then the page will remain as is.
